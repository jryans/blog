Today LLVM release 9.0 branched, here's what changed in a hot-cold map. Click on the diagrams for the interactive view.

[![Changes in C++ files outside tests](https://weliveindetail.github.io/git-baobab/examples/llvm9-cpp-sources.png)](https://weliveindetail.github.io/git-baobab/examples/llvm9-cpp-sources.html)

The diagram shows the accumulated changes in C++ files outside tests since Release 8.0 branched on Jan 16, 2019. The size of an arc represents the amount of change in a file/directory relative to its sibling files/directories. The color of an arc indicates the amount of change relative to its line count today. The amount of change is the sum of insertions and deletions.

I generated the diagram with [git-baobab](https://github.com/weliveindetail/git-baobab), a little tool I played around with in spare time during the last months:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
$ cd llvm-project
$ git checkout release/9.x
$ git merge-base origin/release/8.x HEAD
7b5565418f4d6e113ba805dad40d471d23bca6f6
$ git baobab 7b5565418f4 --cpp -exclude "/(test|unittest|unittests)/"

Here are two more examples from the ongoing release.

The left diagram uses the `--cmake` flag, which includes `CMakeLists.txt` files as well as files with `.cmake` or `.in` extensions. Speciically for people working with the JIT components of LLVM, the right diagram shows what changed in ExecutionEngine C++ files.
