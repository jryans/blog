title:  "LLDB regained JITed code debugging feature"
description: "A regression that reached back to version 6 was fixed in the latest release."

Last week [LLVM 12 was officially released](https://releases.llvm.org/){:target="_blank"} and with it a new LLDB version that (finally!) regained source-level debug support through the [GDB JIT interface](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/JIT-Interface.html){:target="_blank"}. It has been broken in releases 6 to 11 [due to a regression](https://llvm.org/PR36209){:target="_blank"} that involved two autonomous bugs.

The feature is now [continuously tested to work for ELF on x86-64](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/12.x/lldb/test/Shell/Breakpoint/jitbp_elf.test){:target="_blank"}. MachO and COFF don't seem to work and I didn't investigate the state on ARM and other architectures. If you want to give it a quick try without setting up the environment, there is a [Docker container here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/weliveindetail/lldb-12-jit-debug-demo){:target="_blank"} that reproduces it reliably -- additional privileges are required to allow debugging inside the Docker container:

```
> docker run --privileged --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt apparmor=unconfined --rm -it weliveindetail/lldb-12-jit-debug-demo
