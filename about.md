Compiler development is the royal discipline of computing. It always demanded the highest skills from its makers and always fascinated me the most as a developer. Compilers are well understood in academics since long, but mainstream implementations were often lacking behind today's standards -- being quirky, proprietary and hard to master.

With the advent of [LLVM](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2354725/what-exactly-is-llvm) a lot of this changed and today we have state of the art modular compiler technology right at our fingertips -- with a [clean three-phase architecture](www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html), [open-source](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/) and reusable.

My name is Stefan Gr√§nitz and I use this blog to share my experiences. It's a spare time project and does in no way relate to my current employment position.
